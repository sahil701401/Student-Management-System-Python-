# TODO for Enhancing Student Management System User-Friendliness

## Approved Plan: Add Student Mode for Self-Service Viewing of Details by ID

### Steps to Complete:
1. **Modify main() function**: Add mode selection prompt (Admin/Student) at the start of main().
2. **Implement Student Mode Logic**: In student mode, prompt for student ID, load students, search for the ID, and display details if found in a user-friendly format. If not found, show an appropriate message.
3. **Test the Implementation**: Run the updated system to verify both Admin and Student modes work correctly, ensuring student details are displayed accurately and only for the entered ID.

### Progress Tracking:
- [x] Step 1: Modify main() function for mode selection.
- [x] Step 2: Implement student mode logic.
- [x] Step 3: Test the implementation.
